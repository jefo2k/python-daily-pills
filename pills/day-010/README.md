# [Python daily pills] Day 010 - Python Operators (Part 1)

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators

This is the first of a serie of two pills about Python operators. In this one we are going to cover Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison and Logical operators. For the last pill in this serie, [click here](../day-011).

## Python Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator | Name | Example
--- | --- | ---
`+` | Addition | `x + y`
`-` | Subtraction | `x - y`
`*` | Multiplication | `x * y`
`/` | Division | `x / y`
`%` | Modulus | `x % y`
`**` | Exponentiation | `x ** y`
`//` | Floor division | `x // y`

## Python Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

Operator | Example | Same As
--- | --- | ---
`=` | `x = 5` | `x = 5`
`+=` | `x += 3` | `x = x + 3`
`-=` | `x -= 3` | `x = x - 3`
`*=` | `x *= 3` | `x = x * 3`
`/=` | `x /= 3` | `x = x / 3`
`%=` | `x %= 3` | `x = x % 3`
`//=` | `x //= 3` | `x = x // 3`
`**=` | `x **= 3` | `x = x ** 3`
`&=` | `x &= 3` | `x = x & 3`
`\|=` | `x \|= 3` | `x = x \| 3`
`^=` | `x ^= 3` | `x = x ^ 3`
`>>=` | `x >>= 3` | `x = x >> 3`
`<<=` | `x <<= 3` | `x = x << 3`

## Python Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Operator | Name | Example
--- | --- | ---
`==` | Equal | `x == y`
`!=` | Not equal | `x != y`
`>` | Greater than | `x > y`
`<` | Less than | `x < y`
`>=` | Greater than or equal to | `x >= y`
`<=` | Less than or equal to | `x <= y`

## Python Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

Operator | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`and` |  Returns True if both statements are true | `x < 5 and  x < 10`
`or` | Returns True if one of the statements is true | `x < 5 or x < 4`
`not` | Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true | `not(x < 5 and x < 10)`
