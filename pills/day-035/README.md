# [Python daily pills] Day 035 - Anonymous functions

Sometimes, naming a function is not worth the trouble. An example is when youâ€™re sure the function will only be used once. For such cases, Python offers us anonymous functions, also called lambda functions.

A lambda function can be assigned to a variable, creating a concise way of defining a function:

> Note: We have used the Python interpreter, also known as `REPL`, to run the examples. If you don't know what `REPL` is, please [take this pill](../day-005).

```python
>>> add_one = lambda x: x + 1
>>> add_one(3)
4
```

It gets more interesting when you need to use a function as an argument. In such cases, the function is often used only once. As you may know, map applies a function to all elements of an iterable object. We can use a lambda when calling map:

```python
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> times_two = map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)
>>> list(times_two)
[2, 4, 6, 8]
```

> Note: When you need to apply a relatively simple operation on each element of an iterable object, using map() in combination with a lambda function is concise and efficient.
